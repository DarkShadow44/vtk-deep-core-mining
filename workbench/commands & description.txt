Sad to see your outposts depleted and empty ore trains on your rails ? No more with Deep Core Mining ! Refactor your mining outpost to give them a new longterm breath !

This mod is designed to aleviate the "depleted ore outpost" and "need to keep building new outpost forever" problems without a too cheaty ore generator solution. Adds a new type of equivalent ore resources that only spawn in place of depleted field to be mined with specific expensive drill.
- New ore resource "patches" have a 10% chance to spawn under depleted normal ore for Iron, Copper, Coal and Stone.
- Ore patches are like oil and provide an infinite yield that diminish with usage but with a small infinite minimum.
- New advanced and animated mining drill, the Deep Core Mining Drill (DCMD) is used to mine ore patches with associated technology and its own intermediate component ; ~16x more expensive to build but ~13x more powerful than a normal electric mining drill !

The idea is to repurpose old mining outpost when ore is depleted. So the infrastructure is still usefull for the investment of resources and time to replace old drills and building new machines while also providing a small but steady infinite source of ore.

Graphics for the mining drill are not mine, source : https://www.spriters-resource.com/

Todo
- mods support, bob ore, angel ore ? 
- Tool to manually remove ore patches (for cleaning up land if needed), would give a burst of a lot of ore for sacrifying an infinite ore patch (might be in the form of an item that needs reprocessing to prevent inventory clutter).
- Maybe some more ideas (:

Changelog

2018-01-09 - 1.5.0 - Nuclear Age
- Added uranium ore patches and made them glow (inspiration from https://mods.factorio.com/mods/wormmus/wormmus-glowing-ores)
- DCMD can mine uranium ore patches and require sulfuric acid (100 from 10 for normal mining drill)
- DCMD will need a dedicated pump to inject fluid in it
- Changed DCMD ore output to better fit the sprite (you'll need to fix your existing mines)
- DCMD now has circuit interface. Like mining drill or pumpjack can be toggled on/off and read remaining resources (but this seems bugged for now)
- Added min and max for random ore patches values on spawn as a mod setting you can change (defaults from 60 000 to 300 000, same as before)
- Fixed some translations typo & grammar

2017-12-26 - 1.4.2 - Mining speed fix
- DCMD mining speed was bugged because of a leftover test (probably since 1.0 of the mod). Tested with the originally intended 27x more power of a normal mining drill, felt overwhelming (too much ore). It is now ~13x times faster at mining as the normal mining drill (cost unchanged, still ~16x).
Thanks for the report in https://mods.factorio.com/mods/VortiK/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/22655

2017-12-13 - 1.4.1 - Hotfix
- Fixed crash because of missing icon_size on some entity that is now required.

2017-12-13 - 1.4.0 - Version compatibility
- Updated for Factorio 0.16

2017-11-29 - 1.3.1 - Pollution balance
- Balanced DCMD pollution as it was indeed way to high, from 1000 to 150 without module which is closer to the intended ~10-15x a normal mining drill (9 pollution).
It can of course still be reduced by 80% with 3 efficiency modules 1 for ~3x pollution of a normal mining drill (30 vs 9) and ~15x an efficiency moduled mining drill (30 vs 1.8).
Thanks a lot for the detailed feedback in this discussion https://mods.factorio.com/mods/VortiK/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/19928

2017-11-10 - 1.3.0 - Stone age
- Added support for deep core mining of depleted stone with stone patches
- Added map-level mod runtime configurations for enabling each ore patches (iron, copper, coal, stone). All enabled by default, if disabled will prevent spawning of new ore patches when normal ore is depleted.

2017-08-13 - 1.2.0 - Small change
- Changed default minimum range from the start where ore patch spawn on depleted ore from 500 to 250.
- Made the minimum spawn range a setting that can be changed in the mod options game menu.

2017-08-12 - 1.1.1 - Polish
- Minor fix to Deep core mining drill selection box

2017-08-12 - 1.1.0 - Polish & feature
- Ore patches won't spawn on depleted ore in the starting zone < 500 blocs (~1-2 starting area radar size) ; it's a high tech mining solution not available until mid-endgame anyway.
- Added shadow to the Deep core mining drill !
- (internal) Added Factorio community Stdlib : https://github.com/Afforess/Factorio-Stdlib (it's awesome for modding, try it !)

2017-08-11 - 1.0.0 - initial release
