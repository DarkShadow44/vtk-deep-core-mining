Version: 1.6.0
Date: 14. 01. 2018
  Features:
    - Manual mining
    - Added a manual mining feature using a selection tool to select ore patches to remove.
    - Removing ore patches requires deep core mining drones and sulfuric acid barrel for uranium ore patch.
    - Removing ore patches generates ore chunks of 10% of the remaining ore patch up to a max of 1 000 (maxes out at ~300% of ore patch amount).
    - Deep Core Ore chunks require refining with sulfuric acid to get normal ore at 100 per unit.
    - Some graphics of manual mining and refining process are placeholder and may be improved later.
    - Added changelog.txt :)
  Changes:
    - Split Deep Core Mining technology to unlock manual patch removing tools earlier and kept DCMD high tech.
    - Reduced default range from start from which ore patches can spawn from 250 to 0 as there is now a tool to remove them if needed.

Version: 1.5.0
Date: 09. 01. 2018
  Features:
    - Nuclear Age
    - Added uranium ore patches and made them glow (inspiration from https://mods.factorio.com/mods/wormmus/wormmus-glowing-ores)
    - DCMD can mine uranium ore patches and require sulfuric acid (100 from 10 for normal mining drill)
    - DCMD will need a dedicated pump to inject fluid in it
    - DCMD now has circuit interface. Like mining drill or pumpjack can be toggled on/off and read remaining resources (like pumpjacks it will output the mining rate)
    - Added min and max for random ore patches values on spawn as a mod setting you can change (defaults from 60 000 to 300 000, same as before)
  Changes:
    - Changed DCMD ore output to better fit the sprite (you'll need to fix your existing mines)
  Fixes:
    - Fixed some translations typo & grammar

Version: 1.4.2
Date: 26. 12. 2017
  Fixes:
    - Mining speed fix
    - DCMD mining speed was bugged because of a leftover test (probably since 1.0 of the mod). Tested with the originally intended 27x more power of a normal mining drill, felt overwhelming (too much ore). It is now ~13x times faster at mining as the normal mining drill (cost unchanged, still ~16x).
    - Thanks for the report in https://mods.factorio.com/mods/VortiK/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/22655
