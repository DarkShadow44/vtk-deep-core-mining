---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.11.3
Date: 12. 03. 2018
  Changes:
    - Make use of the new "not-rotatable" entity flag. Still mod setting dependant, but it is now a startup setting. This fixes the mining drills being rotatable before placing them and not after.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.11.2
Date: 25. 02. 2018
  Fixes:
    - Fixed Deep Core Mining Drills not working on Cracks and uranium patches aswell as refining processes with Angel's Petrochem reworked Sulfuric Acid liquid (sulfuric-acid > liquid-sulfuric-acid).
    - Fixed last fix fix that actually broke Planner Mining. This is Angel's Petrochem and not Angel's Refining that changes sulfuric acid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.11.1
Date: 25. 02. 2018
  Fixes:
    - Fixed Deep Core Mining Planner not working on Cracks and uranium patches with Angel's Petrochem reworked Sulfuric Acid Barrels (sulfuric-acid-barrel > liquid-sulfuric-acid-barrel)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.11.0
Date: 18. 02. 2018
  Changes:
    - Added support for Dirty Mining mod ores (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/DirtyMining). Will only work for Deep Core Mining supported ores (so currently vanilla and Angels).
    - Internal update of factorio stdlib.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.10.4
Date: 10. 02. 2018
  Changes:
    - Implemented sementic version for proper upgrade comparison triggers.
    - Reimplemented rotation forcing and map labelling update saves before DCM 1.8.2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.10.3
Date: 08. 02. 2018
  Changes:
    - Removed the rotation forcing and map labeling update for before DCM 1.8.2 saves as it could trigger even in later versions.
    - Rotation is still disabled by default but can be enabled in the mod opotions menu. It will only apply to new drills and existing drills placed before DCM 1.8.2 will stay rotatable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.10.2
Date: 07. 02. 2018
  Fixes:
    - Fixed Angel's Ores compatibility with last changes regarding refining yield.
    - Fixed ADCMD collision box that made it un-placable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.10.1
Date: 05. 02. 2018
  Changes:
    - Reduced DCMD and ADCMD collision box a bit to make it easier to navigate around them.
  Fixes:
    - Fixed chemical plant refining ouput to handle more resulting ore as it was limited by ore stack sizes (50) instead of set outputs (100 or 200). You'll need at least 2 upgraded stack inserters to ouput Iron Chunks refining with no down time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.10.0
Date: 05. 02. 2018
  Changes:
    - 1/ Balance pass on DCMD : (Thanks Discord Noxy#5617 for testing & feedback)
    - it proved to be too much and become a main source of ore instead of small but steady,  
    - reduced mining rate by 50%, mining power from 30 to 15.
    - ore patches spawning's min range between patches increased from 5 to 10 tiles.
    - 2/ Balance pass on ADCMD : (Thanks djmad for number crunching https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/5a72339966b10c000a5cf789).
    - it was kinda too expensive especially for iron because of mining drone cost and for coal because of sulfuric acid (if you use coal liquefaction), 
    - increased Deep Core Ore iron chunks refining yield from 100 to 200, 
    - reduced sulfuric acid needed for Coal and Stone chunks refining from 25 to 10, 
    - reduced Deep Core Mining drone cost from 2 to 1 for Deep Core Ore refining.
  Fixes:
    - Reviewed the DCMD drill animation, should be less jittery.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.9.2
Date: 30. 01. 2018
  Changes:
    - Added an "Allow rotation of DCMDs" mod setting (off by default) following popular demand. You'll need to remove and place DCMD again to make them rotatable if you set this setting to Yes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.9.1
Date: 29. 01. 2018
  Fixes:
    - Fixed new setting name and value to not be confusing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.9.0
Date: 29. 01. 2018
  Features:
    - Added beacons prevention enforcing featureâ„¢ (BPEF), when building a beacon near a DCMD it will be removed and droped on the ground (and vis versa). This is because beacons speed module usage on DCMD is overpowered and Deep Core Mining is overpowered enough already featuring an infinite ore source. This is however togglable in the mod options (on by default). Also existing beacons around DCMDs will not be removed as it might be too frustrating.
  Changes:
    - Internal refactoring to help code maintainability (shouldn't break things. Hopefully).
    - Fixed DCMD being fast replacable with themselves. Not really useful is it ?
  Fixes:
    - Fixed math.rand potential issue when ore patches spawn when configured min richness is greater than max richness by making min = max in this case (thanks report by zelitz in https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/5a6c11b08990770009798f53).
    - Fixed settings sort orders.
    - Some locales fixing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.7
Date: 24. 01. 2018
  Changes:
    - Limited modules that can be used on DCMD and ADCMD to only efficiency and reduced from 3 to 2 slots (taking a look a beacon effects limitation aswell as it can be overpowered).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.6
Date: 23. 01. 2018
  Fixes:
    - Fix last fix fix of previous fix's junk added by macos. Thanks macos.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.5
Date: 23. 01. 2018
  Fixes:
    - Fix last fix.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.4
Date: 22. 01. 2018
  Fixes:
    - Critical hotfix to migration upgrade when other mods are updated and not this one. Thanks Discord Noxy#5617 for the report and fix.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.3
Date: 22. 01. 2018
  Changes:
    - Some local updates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.2
Date: 22. 01. 2018
  Changes:
    - Migration for old saves to force DCMD rotation and set all existing ore patches yield to 100% according to new paradigm. Script will notify all players and DCMD that have been affected will be marked on the map.
    - Added decoration clean up on deep core crack spawning to better see it in the world.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.1
Date: 21. 01. 2018
  Fixes:
    - Fix vanilla crash because of angel support test
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.0
Date: 21. 01. 2018
  Features:
    - Adds Angel's Ore support (Angel's Refining mod). Like vanilla ores, Angels ores patches will spawn on depletion and can be manually harvested with the planner tool and refined (thanks Discord SotS#7790 for gfx help).
  Changes:
    - 1/ Major rebalance of ore patches and cracks richness amounts generation & settings. Now fixed to a value of 10 000 (= 100%) and won't deplete. This is to prevent varying mining output (richness can still be changed in mod settings).
    - 2/ Rebalance mining outputs :
    - DCMD should output a bit more than a single lane of a yellow belt but might require a chest or express splitter to keep up the mining speed.
    - ADCMD should require a full redbelt, but might work better if outputing into a chest.
    - 3/ ADCMD custom sounds improvements, now has a starting and stopping sound.
  Fixes:
    - Fixed manual mining with planner tool could fail on certain ore patches (uranium & cracks)
    - Various internal tidying of graphics, locales fixes and code refactoring to improve maintainability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.1
Date: 20. 01. 2018
  Fixes:
    - Removed debugs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.0
Date: 20. 01. 2018
  Features:
    - New Advanced Deep Core Mining drill, bigger, expensiver and it has its own working sound. Dedicated to mine the ...
    - New Deep Core Mining Cack resources that are a rare spawn in the world (~1/500 chance per chunk). Enable to mine the ...
    - New Resource Deep Core Ore Chunk from DCM Cracks that must be refined in a centrifuge and will yield ore chunks that themselves require refining to get ore.
    - DCM Crack can be planner removed and require sulfuric acid to mine (like uranium).
    - Made both DCMD and ADCMD not rotatable and fixed in south orientation to match their sprite (thanks discord @Bilka#2444).
    - Both DCMD and ADCMD require a direct pump to inject sulfuric acid when mining uranium ore patch and deep core mining crack (pipes will not be enough).
  Changes:
    - Review descriptions & locales.
    - Review Technologies, now in 3 tiers with appropriate cost and requirements. Migration is done for existing saves.
    - Resorted all DCM items in inventory (should be better if not perfect).
    - Changed spawn range setting and new default is 1 (from 250) as all deep core ore resource entities can be manually harvested and removed if needed with 1.6.0 planner tool.
    - Review DCMD graphics, adds ore exit and proper pipe input.
  Fixes:
    - Sounds tuning, graphics enhancements and code improvement accross the board.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.6.1
Date: 14. 01. 2018
  Fixes:
    - Removed crash inducing migration file that shouldn't be there.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.6.0
Date: 14. 01. 2018
  Features:
    - New Manual Mining feature using a selection tool to select ore patches to remove.
    - Removing ore patches requires deep core mining drones and sulfuric acid barrel for uranium ore patches.
    - Removing ore patches generates ore chunks of 10% of the remaining ore patch up to a max of 1 000 (maxes out at ~300% of ore patches amount).
    - Deep Core Ore chunks require refining with sulfuric acid to get normal ore at 100 per unit.
    - Some graphics of manual mining and refining process are placeholder and may be improved later.
    - Added changelog.txt :)
  Changes:
    - Split Deep Core Mining technology to unlock manual patch removing tools earlier and kept DCMD high tech.
    - Reduced default range from start from which ore patches can spawn from 250 to 1 as there is now a tool to remove them if needed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.5.0
Date: 09. 01. 2018
  Features:
    - Nuclear Age
    - Added uranium ore patches and made them glow (inspiration from https://mods.factorio.com/mods/wormmus/wormmus-glowing-ores)
    - DCMD can mine uranium ore patches and require sulfuric acid (100 from 10 for normal mining drill)
    - DCMD will need a dedicated pump to inject fluid in it
    - DCMD now has circuit interface. Like mining drill or pumpjack can be toggled on/off and read remaining resources (like pumpjacks it will output the mining rate)
    - Added min and max for random ore patches values on spawn as a mod setting you can change (defaults from 60 000 to 300 000, same as before)
  Changes:
    - Changed DCMD ore output to better fit the sprite (you'll need to fix your existing mines)
  Fixes:
    - Fixed some translations typo & grammar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.2
Date: 26. 12. 2017
  Fixes:
    - Mining speed fix
    - DCMD mining speed was bugged because of a leftover test (probably since 1.0 of the mod). Tested with the originally intended 27x more power of a normal mining drill, felt overwhelming (too much ore). It is now ~13x times faster at mining as the normal mining drill (cost unchanged, still ~16x).
    - Thanks for the report in https://mods.factorio.com/mods/VortiK/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/22655
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.1
Date: 13. 12. 2017
  Fixes:
    - Fixed crash because of missing icon_size on some entity that is now required.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.0
Date: 13. 12. 2017
  Changes:
    - Updated for Factorio 0.16
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.1
Date: 29. 11. 2017
  Changes:
    - Balanced DCMD pollution as it was indeed way to high, from 1000 to 150 without module which is closer to the intended ~10-15x a normal mining drill (9 pollution). It can of course still be reduced by 80% with 3 efficiency modules 1 for ~3x pollution of a normal mining drill (30 vs 9) and ~15x an efficiency moduled mining drill (30 vs 1.8).
    - Thanks a lot for the detailed feedback in this discussion https://mods.factorio.com/mods/VortiK/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/19928
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 10. 11. 2017
  Features:
    - Stone age
    - Added support for deep core mining of depleted stone with stone patches
    - Added map-level mod runtime configurations for enabling each ore patches (iron, copper, coal, stone). All enabled by default, if disabled will prevent spawning of new ore patches when normal ore is depleted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 13. 08. 2017
  Changes:
    - Changed default minimum range from the start where ore patch spawn on depleted ore from 500 to 250.
    - Made the minimum spawn range a setting that can be changed in the mod options game menu.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.1
Date: 12. 08. 2017
  Fixes:
    - Minor fix to Deep core mining drill selection box
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 12. 08. 2017
  Features:
    - Ore patches won't spawn on depleted ore in the starting zone < 500 blocs (~1-2 starting area radar size) ; it's a high tech mining solution not available until mid-endgame anyway.
    - Added shadow to the Deep core mining drill !
    - (internal) Added Factorio community Stdlib : https://github.com/Afforess/Factorio-Stdlib (it's awesome for modding, try it !)
