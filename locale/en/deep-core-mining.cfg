[technology-name]
  vtk-deepcore-mining=Deep Core Mining Technology

[technology-description]
  vtk-deepcore-mining=Advanced technology for deep exploitation of resources in ore patches from depleted ore fields. Enable to revive empty mining outposts.

[item-description]
  vtk-deepcore-mining-drill=A powerful and advanced mining drill capable of extracting resources from depleted ore fields. Must be placed on an ore patch that appear on depleted ore (~10% chance). Costs ~16x electric mining drills but produce ~27x more ore almost forever (depletion similar to oil with a low infinite rate of extraction).
  vtk-deepcore-mining-drone=Component of the Deep Core Mining Drill. No other usage for now.
